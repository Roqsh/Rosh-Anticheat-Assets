These Assets are designed for Rosh Anticheat (currenttly at v1.21 and private)

The Anticheat itself is designed for Minecraft Bedrock Edition and specifically targets PC players.
This Ressource Pack changes the way kick messages in Minecraft Bedrock Edition look to improve the visual look of Rosh Anticheat.
It works by removing the message 'You have been kicked' or 'You have been kicked for:' to allow a custom message.

Feel free to use this aslong as you give credit! <3
